<p>In the upcoming lecture, we will be adding the ingress-nginx service name and namespace to our axios request. This is more or less a reminder to run <code>kubectl get services -n ingress-nginx </code>as shown in the previous lecture "<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/microservices-with-node-js-and-react/learn/lecture/19122264#questions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cross Namespace Service Communication</a>" to find the correct service name for your specific Kubernetes provider.</p><p>At the time of writing, the service name for Docker Desktop will most likely be <strong>ingress-nginx-controller</strong>. </p>
